  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: November 26, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>BladePeek</strong> is a mobile application designed to assist wind turbine technicians in capturing and organizing internal blade inspection photos and associated metadata. This privacy policy explains how the app handles user data and ensures compliance with Apple App Store guidelines, including Section 5.1 related to user privacy and data use.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> The app captures inspection photos using the device camera. These images remain stored locally on the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> BladePeek stores basic inspection metadata related to the damage (e.g. blade section, chamber, observed damage type, radius). This information is entered manually by the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspection date:</strong> The app stores the date of inspection (format YYYY-MM-DD).</li>
    <li><strong>License token / device access code:</strong> A device-specific access code is entered by the user to generate a local license token used to unlock app functionality. The original access code is not stored, transmitted, or linked to personal identifiers. The license token is stored only on the device and is never used for tracking or analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal information:</strong> The app does not collect or request names, email addresses, technician IDs, or any other personal identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Location data:</strong> GPS or precise location data is not collected or used.</li>
    <li><strong>Accounts:</strong> BladePeek does not create or manage user accounts, and does not offer account registration or sign-in.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics or crash reporting:</strong> The app does not collect analytics, usage statistics, or crash reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All data (photos and metadata) is stored locally on the user's device within the app’s sandboxed storage.</li>
    <li>BladePeek does not upload or sync data to any external cloud service or server controlled by the developer or third parties.</li>
    <li>The user may choose to manually export or share data using standard iOS features (e.g., the Files app, zip sharing, AirDrop, email, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>BladePeek does <strong>not</strong> share data with any third parties. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is not transmitted to Apple, Google, Expo, or any other third-party service providers by the app.</li>
    <li>There is no backend server collecting or storing data.</li>
    <li>The app does not use advertising, analytics, or crash-reporting SDKs.</li>
    <li>The app does not send any personal data or inspection data to third-party AI services or external machine learning APIs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. User Control and Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users can delete photos and metadata from the app at any time using the app’s built-in tools or through the iOS Files app, depending on how data has been exported.</li>
    <li>Users can export their data in the form of folders, CSV logs, and image files using standard iOS sharing options.</li>
    <li>No personal information is required to use the app.</li>
    <li>Camera access is requested only when capturing photos, and solely for the purpose of taking inspection images. Users can revoke this permission at any time via the iOS Settings app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security and Offline Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>BladePeek is designed for secure, offline use. No data leaves the device unless the user explicitly chooses to export it.</li>
    <li>There are no background network processes or automatic data transmissions.</li>
    <li>BladePeek does not track users across apps or websites and does not use any advertising identifiers (such as IDFA).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>BladePeek is intended for use by professional wind turbine technicians and is not directed to children. The app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
